## **2. Website Structure**

### **Pages:**

1. **Home Page:** Introduction to the customer service website and its functionalities.
2. **Chat Page:** Users can interact with the chatbot powered by Gemini API.
3. **Support Page:** Users can find basic contact information and additional resources.

## **3. Design Patterns Used**

To ensure scalability and maintainability, the following **design patterns** will be implemented:

### **1. Singleton Pattern**

- Ensures that a single instance of the Gemini API connection is created.
- Centralizes API connections and configurations to prevent redundancy.

### **2. Factory Pattern**

- Dynamically generates different response handling mechanisms.
- Allows flexibility in expanding chatbot functionalities without modifying core logic.

### **3. Observer Pattern**

- Updates the Streamlit interface in real-time when new responses are received.
- Ensures a seamless experience by dynamically displaying chatbot responses.

### **4. Decorator Pattern**

- Adds extra functionalities to chatbot responses, such as logging or response formatting.
- Enhances user experience without modifying the chatbot's core logic.

## **4. Implementation Details**

### **Technologies & Libraries:**

- **Python** for backend logic.
- **Streamlit** for the web-based UI.
- **Google Gemini API** for AI-powered responses.

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Set up a Streamlit app** with three pages.
2. **Integrate Gemini API** for chatbot responses.
3. **Create a structured UI** with navigation between pages.
4. **Implement basic functionalities** for customer support.
5. **Deploy the website** for public access.

## **5. How to Run**

### **Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.8+ installed.
- Git installed (optional, for cloning).
- Google Gemini API Key.

### **Setup Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd project
    ```

    _(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL if applicable)_

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Gemini API Key:**

    - Set an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key.
    - _Alternatively, modify `config.py` if it's designed to read the key from there._

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    Use one of the following commands:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    _Or, if you encounter launcher errors, try running as a module:_

    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

6.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
